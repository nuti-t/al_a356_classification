# Aluminium Al-A356 Classification

This project is aimed to classify the Aluminium Al-A356 into 5 classes from the microstructure image. Al-A356 can be classified by Eutectic Silicon shape. The lower class is larger and longer than the higher class. The main problem in Aluminium Al-A356 classification is the similarity of the adjacent classes which is very hard to classify by the human perceptual, so I use the CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks) to solve this problem.
